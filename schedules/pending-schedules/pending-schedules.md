# Pending Schedules

As you know, Ferro can keep your schedules organized, in a living document, accessible anywhere and to everyone. Whenver your company has a change, you can easily go into Ferro and update the schedule. This way the insured, broker, and possibly other parties are all working from the same place, ensuring no one is out of date. 

Now - there are also times when you know your schedule is going to change. Perhaps you have a property sale pending, that will be executed at the first of the next month.  While the sale is on your mind, you can enter that information into Ferro today.  This is where **Pending Schedules** can help.

If you are interested in this feature, please contact Ferro and we can work with you.
